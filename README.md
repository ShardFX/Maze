Maze

> **IMPORTANT**: Any student submitting the codes as their own is an act of plaigarism and 
is a violation of Washington State University's *"Student Honor's Code"*. The 
intention of me posting my programs is for collaboration and to hear 
feedbacks on possible improvements on the coding. This code repository also serves as my code 
portfolio and its purpose is for future employers to examine my coding skills. Please reference 
if you use part of the code and pleae **DO NOT PLAGIARIZE**. *"Academic Dishonesty"* falls under 
the *Standards of Conduct for Students*.

A 2 dimensional array of characters that represents a maze. Each position can contain either be a wall or a blank. Starting at position (0, 0), list any path through the maze to get to location right lower corner of the maze. Only horizontal and vertical moves are allowed. If no path exists, write a message indicating there is no path. Problem taken from Chapter 9 of Problem Solving and Program Design in C by Hanly &amp; Koffman.
